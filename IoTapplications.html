    <h1> SELF-INTRODUCTION </h1>
    <p> HI, My name is Aditya Sheoran and I am from Rohtak, Haryana. It's my second year in BE Software Engineering at Chitkara University, Rajpura Punjab.</p>
    <p> Till now I have been gone through almost 11 units of this course. Units- SEB101 Engineering Physics, SIT192 Discrete Mathematics, SIT217 Software Engineering:1, SIT111 Algorithms and Computing System,SIT102 Introduction to Programming,SIT123 Data Capture Technologies,SIT232 Object Oriented Development, SIT103 Data and Information Management,SIT221 Data Structures and Algorithms,SEJ101 Design Fundamentals SIT103 Data and Information Management. After going through all these units I have learned a lot. I learned different types of languages like-c++, python, c# etc. I have also worked on the hardware components like made some projects based on my course. 
    <h1> Description of Activities </h1>
    <h2> ACTIVITY 1:- </h2>
    <p>  In this activity, I learned about the IoT applications, as IoT means Internet of Things and describes the network of physical objects which are connected with some software or other technologies. Some examples like- Self Healing machines, Home Security etc. I also learned about the features needed in IoT application in this activity. </p>
    <h2> ACTIVITY 2:- </h2>
    <p> In this activity, I came to know about the role of 'smart building' in the IoT applications. How this smart makes the devices better and how the devices work along with smart building. Actually, smart building makes the device more interactive, digital and easy to use. </h2>
    <h2> ACTIVITY 3:- </h2>
    <p> In this activity, I learned about thecontrol interface required for a smart building IoT application. I also learned about the high level features required for this interface, who are the users and  What are the parts needed to make this work. </h2>
    <h1> LIST OF IoT APPLICATIONS </h1>
    <ol> 
        <li>Smart Farming</li>
        <li>Smart Contact Lenses</li>
        <li>Motion Detection</li>
